# Workflow State

## Active Repair Status

The standalone installer compatibility repair and isolated verification pass. Its
OpenSpec tasks and verification record are authoritative for this branch.
No live installation or release is authorized; isolated tests and a PR are.

## Historical Status

Tasks 16.18-16.20 are complete. Commit `7b797fe` reached `origin/main`, but
Auto Release run `31695733067` exhausted the bounded Profile/Wrapper retry
before every release effect. The three Release validation paths now publish a
percent-encoded final verbose tail through a fail-closed GitHub error
annotation. Fresh Python 3.12 verification passes Update/Release 178/178 and a
clean `VERSION=0.1.15` Profile/Wrapper candidate 227/227; strict OpenSpec,
DevFlow, static, JSON, package, and asset gates pass. Gate `5cc1e103...` is
resolved for one exact commit/push and the `v0.1.15` Auto Release chain, with
every `v0.1.14` mutation excluded.

## Next Action

Commit the verified generic public diff and submit the approved pull request. Historical release authority
above does not authorize new release publication or a direct push to main.
